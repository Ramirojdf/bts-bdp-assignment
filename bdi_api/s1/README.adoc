1. Download and configure https://github.com/miquelfarre/bts-bdp-assignment[the app] to run on your machine
2. Familiarize yourself with https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/[`FastAPI`] and the example endpoints and tests
3. Download a couple of files of our https://samples.adsbexchange.com/readsb-hist/2023/11/01/[flights data] and understand it using its https://www.adsbexchange.com/version-2-api-wip/[documentation]
4. Build the exercises found in the files from this folder


TIP: Explore how to write clean and concise code in python. Best practices and testing your code is something that will help you understand what you wrote 6 months ago way.


== How to deliver the solution

1. Commit and push your code to github.
2. Go to your GitHub's commit history, take a screenshot and upload it to campus

I'll use the latest commit shown in the snapshot to evaluate your code.

== How will the exercises be evaluated?

1. The application does not compile/start -> 0 automatically
2. Virtual environments are not used -> 0 automatically
3. I'll run a series of data validation tests against your application (4 points)
 * % of passed tests
4. Code quality and best practices (2 points)
 * Code linting with `ruff`
 * Tests you have implemented (coverage and completeness)
 * Having failing tests results in a 0 for this section
5. Questions about the practice (4 points)
 * You will be asked questions about how you implemented your solution
 * You must be able to explain your code and the decisions you made

TIP: to ensure you have added all the needed libraries,
clone your code in another folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then run the tests/app.

== Links of interest

TIP: Try not to use Windows and use WSL2 instead: a linux "layer" for windows.
